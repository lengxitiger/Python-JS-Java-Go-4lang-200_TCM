## Technical Pain Points 💢 The World Has Long Suffered from the "Three Sins"!
- **Low-quality Code** is like a quack prescribing medicine - treating a headache by cutting off the head, and a foot pain by amputating the foot.
- **Single-language Thinking** is like a one-flavor decoction - with a biased nature and taste, making it hard to balance yin and yang.
- **Ineffective Overtime** is like draining the pond to catch fish - leaving one weak and vulnerable, with health and productivity both in peril. 
## Preview of Achievements 🏆 The "Ascension" Effects of Practicing This Technique
- Code organization like "Wu Mei Pill" with a well-ordered combination of ingredients → Maintenance cost ↓ 30%
- Cross-language development like "Acupuncture Point Pairing" → Development efficiency ↑ 50%
- Hairline like "Danggui Buxue" → Anti-aging index ⭐⭐⭐⭐

### 🐍 Multilingual Cognitive Growth Path (From Python Basics to Advanced Multi-paradigm)
#### 1. **Beginner-Friendly Layer (Python Foundation)**
- **Python** → The Universal Glue Language (Simple Syntax / Rich Libraries / Easy to Get Started)
> 🎯 First, master basic programming concepts (variables / loops / functions / classes) with Python, understand the core logic of "solving problems through code", and establish programming thinking habits.
#### 2. **Data Interaction Layer (Mandatory SQL Course)**
- **SQL** → Standard Language for Database Operations and Queries (Insert, Update, Delete, Select / Table Joins / Aggregate Analysis)
> 🎯 **Must be mastered first!** Whether you are doing web development, data analysis, or backend services, you need to "talk" to the database with SQL. Writing a web crawler in Python and then storing data in MySQL? Need to check user orders when doing backend work in Java? SQL is the "master key" that connects programs and data!
> **Learning Timing**: Start immediately after completing the basics of Python and use it in conjunction with Python (for example, using Python's `pymysql`/`sqlite3` libraries to operate the database), to understand the entire chain from "code generates data → SQL manages data → code consumes data".
#### 3. **Full-Stack Cognitive Layer (Web Three-Piece Set Expansion)**
- **JavaScript** → Front-end Interaction and Dynamic Logic (Dual Environments: Browser/Node.js)
- **Java** → Enterprise-level Server-side and Cross-platform Stability (Spring Ecosystem/Android Foundation)
- **Go** → High Concurrency and Cloud-native Power Tool (Microservices/Docker/K8s Best Companion)
  ?? **Contrastive Learning**: Have you written data statistics scripts with Python + SQL? Try building a backend API with Java Spring Boot and MySQL database! Have you created web forms with JS? Check out how Go uses coroutines to handle 100,000 concurrent requests! By solving the same type of problems with different languages (such as user management: Python uses dictionaries to store data / Java uses Spring Data JPA / Go uses struct slices / SQL uses table association queries), understand the "native strength areas" of each language.
#### 4. **Cognitive Expansion Layer (Multi-Paradigm Collision)**
- **Language Feature Comparison**:
- Python's "Dynamic Typing + Interpretive Execution" vs Java's "Static Typing + JVM Optimization" vs Go's "Compiled + Goroutine Concurrency" vs SQL's "Declarative Query Language"
- Differences in toolchains across languages (Python uses pip / Java uses Maven / Go uses go mod / SQL uses MySQL Workbench / DBeaver)
- **Cross-Language Practice**:
  Implement the same problem in multiple languages (e.g., data processing: Python uses pandas / Java uses Stream API / Go uses goroutine slices / SQL uses `GROUP BY` aggregation), and observe the differences in code style and performance.
#### 5. **System Magic Box Layer (Core Breakthrough at the Bottom Layer)**
- **C** → Direct manipulation of memory and hardware (pointers/memory management/system calls)
- **C++** → Object-oriented + zero-cost abstraction (STL/template metaprogramming/low-level optimization for multithreading)
> 🛠️ **Key Transition**: When you encounter performance bottlenecks in high-level languages (such as Python being too slow when processing big data), write a high-performance module in C/C++ to speed it up, and understand how the underlying principles support the "speed and stability" of the upper-level application.
#### 6. **Ultimate Mindset**
> "Programming languages are merely tools - Python gets you started, SQL helps you manage data, and Java/Go/C++ assist you in building systems! Master how to use them first, then understand why, and finally choose the right tool to solve the right problem."
#### 📌 Friendly Tips for Beginners
- **Start with Python and SQL**: Don't dive into complex languages right away! First, write some small tools with Python (like automatically organizing files), and then use SQL to store and retrieve data (such as keeping a diary with SQLite). This will build your confidence that "I can solve problems with code"!
- **When learning a new language, ask yourself three questions**:
1. What types of problems is this language best suited to solve?
2. Compared to languages you already know, what are its advantages and disadvantages?
3. Can I use it to optimize projects I've written before?

**The Compendium of Materia Medica for Code - Specializing in Treating Insufficiency of Qi and Blood in Multilingual Programming**

## 💡 Design Philosophy: When Programming Meets Traditional Chinese Medicine 
This project is not merely a collection of code samples; it is an attempt at integrating cross-disciplinary thinking. 
- **Holistic View**: Each case is regarded as a "syndrome", and the code is the result of "diagnosis and treatment".
- **Diagnosis and Treatment**: Different languages are like different medical schools, each with its own strengths (Python is like the warm-nourishing school, Go is like the purging school).
- **Formula Thinking**: Functions are like medicinal ingredients, modules are like formulas, and their combination emphasizes the principle of sovereign, minister, assistant, and messenger.
- **Preventive Treatment**: Emphasizes coding standards, environment isolation, and minimizing dependencies to prevent "technical imbalance". 
A skilled diagnostician examines the complexion and feels the pulse to first distinguish between yin and yang; a skilled programmer first clarifies the requirements and then selects the language. ```

## 🧪 Environment Configuration (Windows) 

#### For fellow practitioners who have a ready-made four-language environment, creating a new IntelliJ project can save most of the following steps.

```diff
Core Principle: Avoid complex build tools and focus on language comparison learning.

Essential Environment:

Language: Python 3.12+ Installation Suggestion: Anaconda3 (pre-installed environment) - Download from the official website and add environment variables.
Language: Node.js v22.14+ Installation Suggestion: Download the official installation package and add environment variables.
Language: Go 1.23.3+ Installation Suggestion: Download the official installation package and add environment variables.
Language: Java GraalVM 21.0.7+ Installation Suggestion: Download GraalVM 21.0.7 from the official website and add environment variables.
IDE: IntelliJ 2024.1+ Installation Suggestion: Install Python/Go plugins. 
Groovy Version: 4.0.28 (Dynamic Java, not used in this project - optional) ```
```
Three-step Quick Configuration
Create a New Java Project ! [Java Settings](images/img.png)
Manually add the dependent JARs in the lib folder. Get familiar with it first. You can also add them when you encounter issues with third-party libraries not running. Only three JAR dependencies are used, so you can skip this for now. ! [Java Setup](images/img_12.png)
(No Maven/Gradle, to avoid increasing the complexity of dependencies)
Remember to add the Java directory in 4languages.iml, otherwise it won't compile. (I put it in a package. You can replace it with mine or configure it yourself.) ! [Java Settings](images/img_1.png) 
Multi-language plugin installation 
[Settings → Plugins] --> B [Install Go Plugin]
A --> C [Install Python Plugin] ! [Install Plugin](images/img_3.png) 
Environmental recognition configuration 
In Node.js: Settings → Languages and Frameworks → Node.js, you can check the box for "Coding Assistance" and just select "npm". ! [Node.js Settings](images/img_2.png) 

Go: Language and Framework → Go → Specify SDK Path ! [Go Settings](images/img_4.png) 
In Python: Settings → Add Console Python Interpreter, it has an impact on the terminal run and default environment. ! [Set up and add a Python interpreter](images/img_5.png)
The project also needs to add Python dependencies. Adding dependencies to the project library rather than the global library is recommended as GraalVM will repeatedly scan the dependencies of Anaconda, which can slow down the Java compilation speed by at least 2-3 seconds. ! [Add Python Interpreter to Project](images/img_6.png) 

?? Efficiency Tip: Set Ctrl+Shift+N as the mouse wheel click, and enter the number (65) to quickly open the four-language file. Shift + cursor click + Enter -> Open multiple files simultaneously. ! [Efficiency Tips](images/img_10.png) 
Dependency management, do it yourself, do it yourself, do it yourself, say it three times. If the library installation is slow, remember to add a mirror site. Choose more by yourself and search online. Although this project doesn't require many libraries to be installed, everyone must know how to do it:
Python: The Anaconda environment already has most of the libraries. For the few that are missing, use pip install to randomly punch and defeat the master. You can install them globally (note that try not to mix them with your existing Python environment for other projects. New installations are fine.) 
Node.js: npm install (First, use npm simply. For now, don't touch other package managers like pnpm, yarn, or Bun. Copy the original files in my project. If you can't find the library, reinstall it in the terminal under the project's JS directory. Do not install it globally.) 
Run: `go mod tidy` (Be careful with GOPATH manipulation. The key points are to initialize in the terminal of the Go project directory. Third-party libraries can only be installed in the project directory, not globally.) 
The Java:lib directory already contains the necessary JAR packages. Manually add JAR dependencies to the lib folder. See the screenshot. 

#### After creating the project according to my naming convention, you can try replacing all my folder files. See if it can run. 
> If there are any issues, paste all the PY, JS, GO, and 4JAVA files into your newly created project located at D:\ad\4languages. It should be able to run. Pay attention to the content of 4languages.iml. You can configure it yourself or follow my example. It shouldn't be too complicated. The scripts run independently. If there are any details I haven't covered, you can search online or leave a message for me. Don't be impatient. The process of trying it out is exactly the time when you think, solve problems, and level up.

> There is a certain probability that the imported project may not be compatible. Your newly created project is based on the default configuration of your own IDEA. Can it run after being copied into the progressive directory? Keep it up! 💪

⚙️ Operating Guide
All scripts run independently. Recommended operation:
Automatic line break mode ! [Automatic line break](images/img_8.png)
View console output with automatic line wrapping. ! [Add folder bookmark](images/img_9.png)
Preview after project management configuration is completed ! [Project Management Preview](images/img_13.png) ! [Project Management Preview](images/img_14.png) ! [Project Management Preview](images/img_15.png)
Those who are interested can give this esoteric thing a try.
Classpath pollution: Your -classpath contains a large number of Python-related library paths (such as anaconda3, python_stubs, typeshed, etc.). These paths may be mistakenly scanned or preloaded by GraalVM, but are actually not used. Pay attention if such a situation occurs. ! [Project Management Preview](images/img_16.png) !

?? The Philosophy of Programming in Traditional Chinese Medicine
Code is like a prescription, and algorithms are like medicinal herbs.
Some cases in the project are designed based on the concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as: 
155. Binary Tree Seven Treasures Black Beard Pill.py: Balance and Nourishment Algorithm 
165. Hash Table - Advanced Chinese Medicine Management.py: Quick Retrieval of Medicine Attributes 
196. Practical Application - Chinese Herbal Medicine Compatibility.py: Multi-language Collaboration Strategy 
Important Notice:
The names of the prescriptions and the dosages of the medicinal materials presented in the project are only for demonstrating cross-disciplinary concepts and should not be applied in practice!
Please follow the doctor's advice for specific medication. The developer is not responsible for any medical decisions. 
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions 
### Q1: Why not use Docker / Why no one-click environment provided?
A: This project focuses on the **comparison learning of the languages themselves**, avoiding the cognitive burden brought by containers/build tools. In real development, you can containerize as needed. 
### Q2: What should I do if the images don't load or the path is incorrect?
A: Please make sure you have downloaded the entire repository (including the images/ directory), or manually replace them with the corresponding screenshots on your local machine. 
### Q3: Want to contribute code / add new cases?
A: Welcome to submit a PR! It is recommended to follow the existing directory structure and keep each case independent and readable. 
### Q4: Will not understanding the analogies in traditional Chinese medicine affect learning?
A: Not at all! The terms from traditional Chinese medicine are just for fun. All the code is well-commented and has practical value. ```

## 🚫 Why does this project reject Docker? 

### Hardcore Learning Principles
1. **Muscle Memory First**
- The container is like an automatic transmission, but we need to train the precise control of a manual transmission. 
2. **Realistic Battlefield Restoration**
- The production environment doesn't have the perfect world of `docker-compose up` 
3. **The Systemic View of Traditional Chinese Medicine**
- Understanding the interdependent and mutually restrictive relationships among various parts of the environment 
You will gain:
- The ability to debug when the system crashes, which can be life-saving.
- Confidence in "bare-metal deployment" without relying on any tools.
- A deep sense of control over the technology stack. 
## 🚫 We reject:
- The illusion of one-click `docker-compose up`
- The mindless dependency of `apt-get install`
- The brute-force approach of `reboot` whenever there's a problem 
We insist on:
1. Tracing system calls with `strace`
2. Analyzing dynamic linking with `ldd`
3. Reading system logs with `journalctl`
4. Profiling performance with `perf` 
When you get used to the comfort of `docker-compose up`:
Your ability to diagnose the environment will regress to that of a baby.
Your understanding of dependencies will remain at the "image magic" level.
When sudden failures occur in the production environment, you can only pray that a restart will work. 
And when you have personally tamed:
- The OpenSSL local jail in Python
- The cross-language pitfall of JNI in Java
- The cross-compilation trap of cgo in Go
- The black hole of node_modules in Node.js... 
Congratulations! You have obtained the ultimate ability of "Environmental Surgeon":
No matter what system crashes, you can perform a craniotomy on it with `strace` + `gdb` 💉 
Even I, who learned the hard way in the workshop, can handle a four-language environment. You guys, with your formal training, can't do without Docker? 
## ❓ Why be so critical of Docker?
- Actually, Docker is really powerful... **but you can't just use it blindly**
- Just like traditional Chinese medicine teaches both "ready-made medicine for quick results" and "diagnosis-based treatment"
- The goal of this project is: **to make you an expert in solving environment issues like an old Chinese doctor** 🏮 
- I hope that everyone's learning environment is a clean, native server environment.
- Without the performance loss caused by Docker, **smooth and enjoyable learning** is achieved.

### 🐳 Docker vs Bare-Metal Server Performance Differences (Practical Reference)

- I feel that the performance degradation is slightly greater than the measured value. It is estimated to be related to the quality of the server hardware configuration and the differences in the running project content.

#### 📊 **Basic Performance Overhead Comparison**
| Scenario                | Docker Performance Overhead | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU Calculation**     | 0% ~ 3%                    | Negligible overhead (Containers share host CPU scheduling with no virtualization cost) |
| **Memory Access**       | 0% ~ 1%                    | Almost no difference in read/write performance (Direct mapping to host physical memory) |
| **Disk I/O (Read)**     | 5% ~ 15%                   | Significantly affected by storage driver (e.g., `overlay2`) and volume type (anonymous/bound mount) |
| **Disk I/O (Write)**    | 10% ~ 30%                  | Additional overhead caused by container layer overlay writes (Copy-on-Write mechanism) |
| **Network Latency**     | 1% ~ 5%                    | Minor forwarding overhead in default `bridge` network mode (Near-native performance with `host` mode) |

> 📌 **Key Conclusion**: CPU/memory-intensive tasks (e.g., algorithm computation, caching services) show negligible impact; disk/network-intensive tasks (e.g., databases, high-concurrency APIs) require optimization focus on storage drivers and network modes.

## 🎨 Project Cultural Symbol Verification
This project includes two original verification template images (Author: ERP Veteran - Cold Stream Tiger Mountain):
1. **[ERP Skill Tree Infographic](./original_poster_images/erp_skill_tree.png)**:
- The title clearly states "ERP Veteran Cold Stream Tiger Mountain Skill Tree", featuring branches of skills such as finance, business, JS, GO, etc. The bottom indicates the amount of processed information - proving this is a comprehensive panorama of my practical technical skills.
2. **[Programmer Health Secret Poster](./original_poster_images/programmer_health_poster.png)**:
- The top left corner features my nickname "ERP Veteran - Cold Stream Tiger Mountain", integrating elements like a furnace, programming icons, MongoDB, etc., to convey the persona of a "technical geek who practices health preservation".

> ⚠️ Note: These two pictures are important components of the project. Their absence may result in incomplete presentation of some content (an Easter egg mechanism reserved by the author).

### 🔐 The Encryption Philosophy of a Multilingual Geek Health Enthusiast: Code as Sword, Protection as Shield
As a veteran deeply involved in ERP practical applications and multilingual programming (a beginner to intermediate player in Java/Python/JS/Go), I am not only adept at business logic and data flow, but have also picked up a bit of "code protection" on the side - after all, good projects are like rare elixirs and need to be safeguarded from accidental deletion or unauthorized copying!
---

?? My Three-Component Encryption Protection System
**"Hash Verification Lock" - Picture as the Key, Deleting the Picture as the Lock**
There are two "soul posters" hidden in the project:
- One is my **ERP Skill Tree Information Diagram** (blue tech style, skill branches covering finance/business/JS/GO, with the title clearly stating "ERP Veteran Leng Xichushan");
- The other is the **Programmer's Health Care Secret Manual Poster** (alchemy furnace + code icon + medicine pot, labeled "ERP Veteran - Leng Xichushan", with health buffs piled up).
  They are not ordinary decorations - I have locked these two pictures using the **SHA-256 hash value + Base64 binary obfuscation encryption**! Once the pictures are deleted or tampered with, the key sections will immediately "close up and refuse visitors" (error message: "Verification failed, please check the integrity of the poster"). Cleaning script? Sorry, you have to first crack my "picture password" to find the hidden content~
2. **"Multilingual Anti-Conflict" - Four-language isolation, clean geek health care**
   The Java/Python/JS/Go four-language environment is independently configured, with physical isolation of dependency libraries. The compilation and running speed is extremely fast (Java takes only 1-3 seconds), and even the environment variables don't interfere with each other. The protection is thorough, eliminating even "cross-language conflicts" as internal waste, allowing you to focus on cultivating core technologies!
---

?? The technical geek health philosophy behind protection measures
- **"Basic Encryption"**: While learning multiple languages, I also read the introductory chapters of "Java Security Coding" and "Python Cryptography in Practice" (understanding hash functions, encoding, and simple obfuscation);
- **"Intermediate Philosophy"**: Based on the practical needs of projects, I transformed encryption technology from "theory" to "protection tools" - for example, using hash verification to ensure that critical content is not accidentally deleted, and using multiple languages for isolation to enhance development efficiency;
- **"Geek Health Goal"**: Not to fight against the entire world, but to enable developers who truly want to learn technology to successfully obtain projects, strengthen secure encryption technology, and at the same time block those "one-click cleaning" script kiddies~
- 😂 "Character Design Easter Egg + Protection Easter Egg"
- The blue technology balls in the "Skill Tree Poster" represent my technical depth, while the alchemy furnace in the "Health Preservation Poster" symbolizes the "sustainable geek health preservation" of programmers - the code needs to be well-written, and the body also needs to be taken care of!

- "Ultimate Hint": If the key sections fail to run, don't panic - check if the files erp_skill_tree.png and programmer_health_poster.png are still present in the project directory (they are the "keys" to unlock the hidden content). If the images are intact but the content is not displayed, it might be that my "protection system" is too strict. Please submit an Issue to help me optimize it~
- 📌 "Security Philosophy": I'm not aiming to create a system that cannot be "completely removed". Instead, I want to impose a cost on the purifiers that is "far greater than the benefits" - either they spend time learning encryption and decryption, or they give up and instead promote my project (after all, good content deserves to be seen!) 。


Path supplement explanation: You must practice repeatedly. At least understand the common writing methods. The explanations of path differences among various languages can be found in the folder (./Other Code Supplement Explanation).

- The IDEA JVM virtual machine configuration file "idea.vmoptions" is placed in the "readme" folder. It can be opened in text mode. These are the parameters that work best for me and they have a relatively high performance setting.
- For those with lower computer configurations, you can adjust the parameters appropriately. Due to the significant differences in devices, we won't go into detail here. If you're unsure, you can send the computer configuration list and JVM configuration parameters to the AI for debugging to obtain the optimal parameters suitable for your computer. 🐯

### Medical Terminology System in the Project (Tech Geeks' Health Care Version)
#### 📜 Core Herbal Repository Preview: There are still 200 types of traditional Chinese medicine programming techniques and more surprises waiting for you to discover!

- **Nine Rare Herbs** (Rare Nourishing Types)
  `Dendrobium`, `Tianshan Snow Lotus`, `Ginseng`, `Rehmannia`, `Poria`, `Mushroom of Immortality`, `Underwater Pearl`, `Winter Worm Summer Grass`, `Cistanche`
> *Corresponding technical scenarios*: The core algorithms/modules in the project (such as multilingual environment isolation, hash deletion prevention verification), as precious as the herbs and supporting the entire system.
- **Digestive Pills Sanxian** (Original Basic Type)
  `[Hawthorn, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Malt]` (Not processed)
> *Technical Mapping*: Basic data processing module (such as raw data cleaning/format conversion), original capabilities but requires further "processing" for optimization.
- **Digestive Medicine Jia San Xian** (Improving Effect Through Processing)
  `[Charred Hawthorn, Charred Asarum, Charred Malt]` (Processed products, with added hemostatic effect)
> *Technical Mapping*: Optimized data processing procedures (such as accelerated compilation / preloading dependencies), enhancing performance on the basic functions through "processing" (even introducing new features).
#### 🩸 Blood-Regulating Medicines (Functional Classification)
- **The Triangular System of Blood Tonification, Activation, and Dissolution**
  `Dang Gui` (for blood tonification), `Dan Shen` (for blood activation), `Oxymyrtinus` (for blood dissolution)
> *Metaphorical Expression*: The three types of operations in data flow processing are -
> - `Dang Gui`: Resource replenishment (such as memory optimization/caching mechanism)
> - `Dan Shen`: Loop acceleration (such as concurrent processing/pipe-line optimization)
> - `Oxymyrtinus`: Redundancy elimination (such as elimination of useless dependencies/deletion of dead code)
#### 🌳 King-Duke-Assistant-Helper (Architecture Design)
- **Original Source**: Derived from the ancient prescription system of "Shennong's Herbal Classic"
- **Technical Mapping**:
- **King Herb** → Core Algorithm (such as the main logic with isolation of four languages environments)
- **Duke Herb** → Auxiliary Module (such as the auxiliary verification of hash)
- **Assistant Herb** → Compatibility Layer (such as the logic for multi-platform account adaptation)
- **Helper Herb** → Entry/Exit (such as the project startup script/export interface)
> *Natural Match*: Binary tree (clear hierarchy), multi-branch tree (cooperation of multiple modules), etc. programming data structures.
- **Red-Black Tree Extension**:
  When adding **popular medicinal materials (high-frequency modules)** + **cold-avoiding medicinal materials (low-frequency but crucial modules)**, the natural adaptation of the **balancing and regulating characteristics** of the red-black tree (such as dynamic priority scheduling) is achieved.
  ⚙️ Matching Logic (Compliance Check)
- **The Seven Combinations of Traditional Chinese Medicine** (from "Shennong's Classic of Materia Medica")
> *Technical Mapping*: Object-oriented detection of medicinal material combinations (such as analysis of inter-module dependencies), ensuring functional synergy without conflicts.
- Synergistic (enhancing together), Mutual Aid (main and auxiliary cooperation), Fear (suppressing side effects)...

- **Eighteen Contradictory Combinations**
> *Technical Mapping*: Object-oriented toxicity detection (such as violation of dependencies / incompatible library versions), avoiding "toxic combinations" (such as runtime crash risks) through compliance monitoring.
?? **"Tech Geek's Health Wisdom"**:
The thousand-year-old wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine's compatibility, perfectly matches the **data structure design** and **system compliance testing** in programming - using ancient wisdom to refine modern code!

?? Introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces (Tech Geeks' Health Tips Edition)
?? Market Circulation Data (with Official Supplementary Materials from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia)
1. **Common Chinese Medicines** (Highly Used in Daily Life)
- **Number of Included Items**: Approximately **200-300 types** (Precise range: 299 core varieties)
- **Typical Examples**: Licorice, Astragalus, Angelica Sinensis, Poria cocos, Ligusticum chuanxiong, etc., which are basic tonic/adjusting medicinal materials, corresponding to the "Basic Tool Library" in the programming (such as data types/common algorithms).
2. **Cold Herbs** (Rare but Unique)
- **Number of Entries**: Approximately **3,000 species** (including local specialties/ethnic medicines)
- **Typical Examples**: Rehmannia glutinosa, Arctium lappa, Cordyceps sinensis (various varieties), Pangolin scales (prohibited), Areca catechu (strictly controlled), etc., corresponding to the "Rare Database/Special Algorithms" in the programming (such as edge computing/quantum programming support).
3. **Official inclusion in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia** (authoritative standard) is expected to come into effect on October 1, 2025.
- **Latest Version (2020 Edition Part One)**: Includes **616 types of Chinese medicinal materials** + **4,567 types of Chinese herbal decoctions (including processed products)**.
- **Core Coverage**: Commonly used Chinese medicines (all 299 basic varieties are included) + Frequent safety varieties of rare medicinal materials (such as some ethnic medicines/locally used medicines);
- **Strict Control**: Toxic medicinal materials (such as arsenic and realgar), endangered species (such as tiger bones and rhinoceros horns) are clearly marked with contraindications and limits;
- **Expanded Data**: If all related standards (such as the Chinese Pharmacopoeia + the National Chinese Herbal Processing Specifications) are included, the actual available types of herbal decoctions exceed **5,000** (including different processing specifications), corresponding to the language ranking in the program and the continuous development and inclusion of new programming ecosystems.
  ?? Estimated Market Trends for Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoction Pieces
- The commonly used varieties closely match the actual situation (299 core varieties account for over 90% of daily prescriptions);
- The 3,000 types of rare medicinal materials are a reasonable estimate (including local/ethnic medicines, but note that approximately 10% of them are controlled or endangered species, and the actual available types are approximately 2,700-2,800);
- **Hidden Easter Egg**: Approximately **30%** of the rare medicinal materials have clear pharmacological research support (such as Rehmannia glutinosa regulating immunity, Artemisia frigida relieving pain), but **60% or more** are still at the traditional experience stage (corresponding to the programming "unverified cold and rare techniques").
  ?? Metaphor of Tech Geeks' Health Care
> "Common traditional Chinese medicines are like programming basic libraries, stable and reliable and used by everyone; rare medicinal herbs are like cutting-edge black technologies, niche but possibly containing disruptive solutions - and the Chinese Pharmacopoeia is the authoritative document of the technological world!" **

⚠️ The names of the medicinal materials mentioned in this project are used only for technical metaphor and do not constitute medical advice.
The actual medicinal material data refer to the 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

### 🧘 Programmers' Health Care Experts' Conclusion: The body is the capital for revolution, while code is the tool for health care for geeks.
Dear code geeks and health enthusiasts (whether you are a "keyboard warrior" working the 996 schedule, or a "cyber monk" following the 007 lifestyle):
After you finish reading this "Four-language Chinese Medicine Programming + Hash Anti-Corruption + Chinese Medicine Compatibility Logic" hardcore document, perhaps you have noticed - **I secretly added the 'Health Preservation' herb into every line of code in the project!**
#### 🍵 Why do programmers need to adopt geeky health practices?
Because what we are typing is not code, but "qi and blood"!
- The "liver blood deficiency" caused by prolonged screen staring requires the consumption of goji and chrysanthemum tea to sustain life;
- The "heart fire excess" resulting from repeated changes in requirements needs to be alleviated with porridge made of poria cocos and lotus seeds;
- The "spleen deficiency and dampness retention" caused by continuous overtime work must be treated with Sanxian (crushed hawthorn / yeast / barley) to aid digestion!
#### 🧪 Our "Geek Health Care Secret Formula"
1. **"Code is the sword, body is the scabbard"**: Even the most advanced algorithms require a healthy body to be realized; even the most robust deletion prevention logic needs a clear mind to be maintained!
2. **"The Three Essentials for Health Care"**:
- **The Red and Black Tree in the Teapot** (Black tea + dried tangerine peel + jujube) - Regulates the spleen, stimulates appetite, and prevents indigestion;
- **The Scratcher beside the Keyboard** (Scraping the shoulders and neck, unblocking the meridians) - Relieves "mouse hand" and "keyboard shoulder";
- **The Eye Protection Spell in Front of the Screen** (The 20-20-20 rule: Look 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes) - Protect your "programmer's eyes"!
3. **"Combining Project with Health Preservation"**:
   In my project, there is a "Alchemy Furnace Poster" (full of health preservation buffs) and also a "Skill Tree Logic" (deep technical training) - because the true "tech master" is always **"skilled in coding and in great health"**!
   ?? Ultimate Blessing (With Geek Health Tips Hidden Inside)
> "May your code-writing be inspired by the Tiger Mountain Skill Tree;
> When fixing bugs, be protected by the vitality of the health tea kettle;
> During version releases, maintain a steady rhythm like the Red and Black Tree;
> When retiring, enjoy the sunset glory like the Alchemy Furnace -
> After all, a programmer who can live to retirement is truly a 'Code Sage'!" **

(P.S. Try the "tomato method"! Every 60 minutes of concentrated programming, take a 10-minute break and stand up - look into the distance to relax the ciliary muscles, turn your neck to relax the trapezius muscles, and take a sip of water to give your lower back a rest. Your cervical and lumbar vertebrae are secretly giving you a thumbs-up! 🐯💻)

#### 🧪 Secret Formula for Cultivating a Geek's Healthy Lifestyle
1. **"Code is like tea, health is like a stove"**
- Take a 5-minute break every hour (fetching water/looking into the distance/neck exercises), a more flexible "micro-rest" rhythm than the Pomodoro Technique;
- Set the screen color temperature to 5000K (protects eyes from yellowish tint, does not cause eye strain), always have chrysanthemum and safflower tea beside the keyboard (cleanses the liver, sharpens vision, and prevents dryness).
2. **"Skill Tree Empowerment"**
- **Huiteda Mountain Skill Branch**: Enhance multi-threading thinking (clear logic without lag) through "Multilingual Traditional Chinese Programming";
- **Alchemy Furnace Talent Points**: Perform daily massages using the scraping board/pharmaceutical hammer in "Health Preservation Posters" (facilitating shoulder and neck circulation and promoting blood and qi circulation).
3. **"Anti-Cabbage Method"**
- Say no to unnecessary overtime! Code efficiency comes from the rigorous logic of the "Hash Verification Anti-Copy System" (less rework = saved energy);
- Do the "Simplified Version of Eight Exercises" before bed (focus on stretching the shoulders and back + warming up the Zunquan acupoint, which helps with sleep and nourishes the kidneys).
  ?? Geek Health Tips for Readers

### ⭐ 5k Milestone: Foundation Building (Low-Cost Social Anchor)

#### Original Plan
- Open and sync other random branches
- Display contributors' "TCM-style titles" in README

#### Optimized Suggestions
| Feature | Implementation | Technical Cost | Experience Boost |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Branch Naming Alchemy** | New branch names must follow "Compendium of Materia Medica" herb nomenclature (e.g., `feature-cistanche-log-optimization` / `fix-notoginseng-api-timeout`). README note: "All branches here are premium herbs—use with caution!" | Simple Git Hook script (detects herb-related keywords in branch names) | Community members trigger herb-based jokes. Example: When someone submits `fix-ginseng-performance-bottleneck`, reply in merge comment: "Ginseng boosts qi—this optimization is truly tonic!" |
| **Dynamic TCM Titles** | Auto-assign humorous TCM-style titles based on contribution types (e.g., Bug fixes → "Evil-Expelling Fire Knight" 🧪 / New features → "Qi-Nourishing Master" / Comment-only → "Pulse-Diagnosing Herbalist") | GitHub Actions parses commit messages with regex rules (e.g., `fix|bug`) to match titles | Contributors get more excited about their titles than stars—e.g., "I got 'Yang-Reviving Grandmaster'? This bug fix was worth it!" |

---

### ⭐ 10k Milestone: Performance Breakthrough (Tech + Meme Double Kill)

#### Original Plan
- Release high-performance Go/Java parser branches
- Auto-convert contributor IDs to "Herb Flower Names" (e.g., @angelica-Distributed)

#### Optimized Suggestions
| Feature | Implementation | Technical Cost | Experience Boost |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Performance with TCM Wisdom** | Key code sections include humorous TCM comments (e.g., Go goroutine pool: "This pool balances cores like Minor Bupleurum Decoction—harmonizing without excess"; Java JIT: "Class loading is like Aconite reviving yang—slow but certain") | Add 1-2 fun comments in critical code paths (no functionality impact) | Developers spot TCM references in high-performance code—e.g., "So Go's goroutine scheduling is 'spleen qi regulation'? These docs are better than official guides!" |
| **Herb Flower ID Mapping** | Maintain a `herb_map.json` (e.g., `{"@user1": "Angelica", "@user2": "Astragalus"}`). GitHub Actions displays "Angelica-Distributed" in commits/issues (real Git author remains unchanged) | GitHub Actions maps commit authors to herb names via JSON lookup | Community races to claim popular herbs (e.g., "Ginseng", "Ganoderma"). Issue threads feature self-intros like "I'm Rehmannia—specializing in memory leak fixes!" |

---

### ⭐ 20k Milestone: Core Hardcore (Tech Faith Reinforcement)

#### Original Plan
- Add C/C++ "Mystical Memory Management" branch
- Hide 《Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon》 (Huangdi Neijing) easter eggs in comments

#### Optimized Suggestions
| Feature | Implementation | Technical Cost | Experience Boost |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Memory Ops with TCM Metaphors** | `malloc` wrapper: "This memory is kidney essence—don’t waste it"; `free`: "Releasing is like detox—stagnation breeds toxins". Hidden easter egg: After 10 allocations, log "Kidney Qi Warning!" | Add fun comments + simple counter logic in C/C++ memory functions (no performance hit) | Devs laugh at memory jokes—e.g., "So everyday `malloc` is 'kidney tonic'? This code teaches health better than textbooks!" |
| **Huangdi Neijing Code Eggs** | Insert classic quotes when triggers appear: `if (error)` → "Evil accumulates where qi is weak"; loop optimizations → "Flowing water never rots"; key algorithms → "Follow yin-yang harmony" | Regex matches keywords (e.g., `error`/`loop`/`algorithm`) to insert 1-line Neijing phrases | Debuggers see ancient quotes and think "This dev is weird"... then subconsciously absorb health wisdom |

---

### ⭐ 100k Milestone: Ecosystem Expansion (Tech + Mysticism Party)

#### Original Plan
- Develop LLM branch
- Auto-generate "Five Elements Balance Report" on commits

#### Optimized Suggestions
| Feature | Implementation | Technical Cost | Experience Boost |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **LLM with TCM Prompts** | Default input suggests "Analyze code logic from 'Yin-Yang balance' perspective"; outputs include "This advice passed 'Five Elements Generation' check" | Add fixed prompt prefix in LLM WebUI/API layer (no core impact) | Users see suggestions like "Split this function per 'Monarch-Minister-Assistant-Envoy' principle..." and think "Weirdly logical!" |
| **Five Elements Commit Analysis** | Map file types to elements (`.go→Metal` / `.py→Wood` / `.java→Fire` / `.cpp→Water` / `.json→Earth`), generate harmony tips (e.g., "This commit mixes Wood (Python) and Earth (JSON)—Wood overpowers Earth. Add comments to balance!") | 5-line file extension → element config + 10-line Git Hook logic (non-blocking) | Devs see warnings like "Metal (Go) dominates—may harm Wood (Python). Check API compatibility!" and reluctantly review dependencies |
